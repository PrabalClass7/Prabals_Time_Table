<!-- My name is Prabal Bhattacharyya
    I am making this webpage as a School Project.

    This Time table can scale according to screensize, thus can be viewed in a mobile too.(It might be zoomed in a bit as the mobile browsers zoom every webpage for better reading, so you have to zoom out a bit)

    Hover your mouse over each subject to see my views on each (Works only in PCs/Laptops, or devices with a mouse cursour)
